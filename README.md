[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) is a great platform for home automation. It's powerful and has a friendly community. [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) is an easy way to integrate custom sensors and switches into Home Assistant. This project is an ESPHome configuration file for a custom CO2, temperature, and humidity sensor with colour status light.
